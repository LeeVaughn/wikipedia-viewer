# wikipedia-viewer
My version of the Build a Wikipedia Viewer project from freeCodeCamp's Front End Developer Certification.

This app allows the user to search Wikipedia and see the results at the bottom of the page. The user can also choose to be taken to a random Wikipedia entry.

To Do List
- add auto complete to search bar.
- fix issue on mobile devices where search icon doesn't center properly.
